//   (short to long) and pass each string to the recognizer function
//   created in Part a).  Hint: use a queue to generate strings
//   Only those strings for which the recognizer returned TRUE
//   should be displayed. 
//   Keeps on going until the queue overflows but the user can
//   terminate the program with control-C 
//   after 20 strings have been displayed.
