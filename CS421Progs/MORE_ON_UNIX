  More on UNIX if you are interested in being more productive....

1.  never use control-Z. It puts your process into background mode.
    To get it back, you have to say fg.

2.  users: If you see yourself logged in twice, you had forgotten to logout.
    Do ps -u to find your process IDs.  Do kill -9 put-ID-here  to 
    kill the idle process.   

3.  command >  file  sends the result of the command to the file
    command < file   takes the input from the file 
    e.g. ./a.out < myinput

4.  command1 | command2   pipes command1 through command2
    e.g.  ls -l | more    

5.  create a file and put a sequence of commands into it.
    Then do source put-file-name-here  to do all the commands.
    e.g. source doit    where doit contains
                        g++ a.cpp b.cpp c.cpp 
                        ./a.out  

6.  grep "words" files-here   to look for the words in the files
    e.g. grep "due date"  HW/*

7.  use wildcard:   e.g.  ls *.cpp   

8.  chmod who+what files
    e.g.  chmod uog+rwx *   means you, others, and group will all be able
                            to read/write/execute all files
