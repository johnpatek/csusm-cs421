In re.txt, you must type all the arrow labels you plan to use, one per line. 
e.g.
a
b
c
Component machines are created for these.

nfa-e.txt will be the output showing the combined machines.



Limitation:  It does not allow you to do (a | a)  or  (a | a*)  
It can be overcome by always making a copy of the component machine first.
